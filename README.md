* Improved scoreboard with Kills/Deaths column
* Information about killer's weapon displayed in chat
* Option to disable level ambient sounds

Compatibility
-------------
Dash Faction is compatible with Red Faction 1.20 North America (NA).
If your game version is 1.00 or 1.10 you have to update it to 1.20 first.
If your edition is not NA or you are using the Steam/GOG version, you have to replace RF.exe with one from the
1.20 NA version (it can be found on https://www.factionfiles.com). The launcher will ask you to do it if it detects
an unsupported executable. The Dash Faction installer does all required changes to the installation automatically.

Supported operating systems: Windows 7 and newer.

Dash Faction also works on Linux when launched through Wine. The latest Ubuntu LTS and vanilla Wine from the latest stable branch are recommended.

Usage
-----
1. Unpack the Dash Faction files to any folder (there is no requirement to put it in the Red Faction folder).

2. Run `DashFactionLauncher.exe`.

3. When running the launcher for the first time, select the "Options" button and adjust the settings to your preference. Make sure the
   game executable path is valid.

4. Close the options window and click the "Launch Game" button to start Dash Faction.

Advanced usage
--------------
You can provide additional command line arguments to the `DashFactionLauncher.exe` application, and they will be forwarded
to the Red Faction process. For example, to start a dedicated server use the `-dedicated` argument just like in the original
game.

Dash Faction specific arguments:

* `-game` - launch the game immediately without displaying the launcher window
* `-editor` - launch the level editor immediately without displaying the launcher window
* `-win32-console` - use a native Win32 console in the dedicated server mode
* `-exe-path` - override the launched executable file path (RF.exe or RED.exe) - useful for running multiple dedicated servers using separate RF directories

Problems
--------
If your antivirus software detects Dash Faction as a malicious program, add it to a whitelist or try to disable
reputation-based heuristics in the antivirus options. It may help as some antivirus programs flag new files as malicious just because they are not widely used.
If you do not trust the author of Dash Faction, you can review its code and compile it yourself - keep in mind it is
open-source software.

During video capture in OBS, please disable MSAA in Options - they do not perform well together.

If you experience any other problems, you can ask for help in the Faction Files Discord server at https://discord.gg/factionfiles.

Additional server configuration
-------------------------------
Dedicated server specific settings are configured in the `dedicated_server.txt` file.

Only the Pure Faction anti-cheat support code is not open-sourced, because it would make PF anti-cheat features basically useless.
It consists of a few files in the *game_patch/purefaction* directory. It is linked statically during a release process
of Dash Faction by the owner of the project.
