Compatibility
-------------
Dash Faction is compatible with Red Faction 1.20 North America (NA).
If your game version is 1.00 or 1.10 you have to update it to 1.20 first.
If your edition is not NA or you are using Steam version, you have to replace RF.exe file with one from the
1.20 NA version (it can be found on FactionFiles.com). Launcher will ask you to do it if it detects
unsupported EXE file. THe Dash Faction installer does all required changes to the installation automatically.

Supported operating systems: Windows 7 and newer.

Dash Faction also works on Linux when launched through Wine. Latest Ubuntu LTS and latest version of vanilla Wine from stable branch is recommended.

Usage
-----
1. Unpack Dash Faction files to some folder (there is no requirement to put it in the Red Faction folder).

2. Run `DashFactionLauncher.exe`.

3. When running launcher for the first time select "Options" button and check if everything is OK (especially make sure
   game executable path is valid).

4. Close options and click "Launch Game" button to start Dash Faction.

Advanced usage
--------------
You can provide additional command line arguments to `DashFactionLauncher.exe` application. They are always forwarded
to the Red Faction process. For example, to start a dedicated server use the `-dedicated` argument just like in the original
game.

Dash Faction specific arguments:

* `-game` - launch the game immediately without displaying the launcher window
* `-editor` - launch the level editor immediately without displaying the launcher window
* `-win32-console` - use a native Win32 console in the dedicated server mode
* `-exe-path` - override the launched executable file path (RF.exe or RED.exe) - useful for running multiple dedicated
  servers using separate RF directories

Problems
--------
If your anti-virus software detects Dash Faction as a malicious program add it to a whitelist or try to disable
reputation based heuristics in the anti-virus options. It can help because some anti-virus programs flags new
not popular files as danger just because they are not popular among users.
If you do not trust this Dash Faction author you can review its code and compile it yourself - keep in mind it is
open-source software.

During video capture in OBS please disable MSAA in Options - it does not perform well together.

In case of problems you can ask for help on Faction Files Discord server (click Discord Support Channel button in
launcher main window).
