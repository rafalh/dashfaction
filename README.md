Compatibility
-------------
Dash Faction is compatible with Red Faction 1.20 North America (NA).
If your game version is 1.00 or 1.10 you have to update it to 1.20 first.
If your edition is not NA or you are using Steam version, you have to replace RF.exe file with one from
1.20 NA version (it can be found on FactionFiles.com). Launcher will ask you to do it if it detects
unsupported EXE file.

Application should work on Windows XP SP3 and newer (tested mostly on Windows 10).

Usage
-----
1. Unpack Dash Faction files to any folder (there is no requirement to put it in Red Faction folder).

2. Run DashFactionLauncher.exe.

3. On first run select Options and check if everything is OK (especially make sure game executable path is valid).

4. Close settings and click "Launch Game" to start Dash Faction.

Advanced usage
--------------
You can provide additional command line arguments to `DashFactionLauncher.exe` application. They are always forwarded
to Red Faction process. For example to start a dedicated server with Dash Faction support use `-dedicated` argument
just like in the original game.

Dash Faction specific arguments:

* `-game` - launch game immediately without displaying the launcher window
* `-editor` - launch mod immediately without displaying the launcher window
* `-win32-console` - use native Win32 console in dedicated server mode

Problems
--------
If antivirus detects Dash Faction as a malicious program try to disable Reputation Services. It can help
because some antiviruses flags new not popular files as danger just because they are not popular among users
and Dash Faction is certainly not very popular :)
I had some problems with Avast silently removing launcher exe and had to add Dash Faction to exclusions of
Behaviour Shield.

During video capture in OBS please disable MSAA in Options - it does not perform well together.

In case of problems you can ask for help on Faction Files Discord server (click Discord Support Channel button in
launcher main window).

Additional server configuration
-------------------------------
Dedicated server specific settings are configured in `dedicated_server.txt` file.
Dash Faction specific configuration must be after the level list (`$Level` keys) and must appear in the order provided
in this description.

    $DF Spawn Protection Duration: 1500
    // Enable hit-sounds
    $Hitsounds: true
        // Sound used for hit notification
        +Sound ID: 29
        // max sound packets per second - keep it low to save bandwidth
