Dash Faction is developed by Rafalh and contributors listed below.

The Dash Faction source code is available on GitHub and licensed under Mozilla
Public License 2.0. See the LICENSE.txt file located in the root directory of
Dash Faction.

Only the Pure Faction anti-cheat support code is closed-source, because
exposing it would make its features practically pointless. It consists of some
files in the 'game_patch/purefaction' directory. It is statically linked
during each Dash Faction release process by the owner of the project.

Dash Faction uses some open-source third-party components. Their licenses can
be found below.
