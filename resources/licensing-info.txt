Dash Faction is developed by Rafalh and contributors listed below.

The Dash Faction source code is available on GitHub and licensed under Mozilla 
Public License 2.0. See the LICENSE.txt file located in the root directory of 
Dash Faction.

Only the Pure Faction anti-cheat support code is closed-source, because 
exposing it would make its features practically pointless. It consists of some 
files in the 'game_patch/purefaction' directory. It is statically linked 
during each Dash Faction release process by the owner of the project.

Dash Faction uses some open-source third-party components. Their licenses can 
be found below.
